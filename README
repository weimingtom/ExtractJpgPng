I. HOW TO BUILD

	1. Please first download OpenCV and boost
	See also:
		http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/
		http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/

	2. Please use cmake and VC2008 to compile 4 libraries in OpenCV-2.2.0\3rdparty, as follow:
		zlib、libpng、libtiff、libjpeg

	(Please use cmake-gui to open CMakeLists.txt, and Add Entry:
	WITH_JPEG
	WITH_PNG
	WITH_TIFF
	then select all,
	or modify CMakeLists.txt.
	Press button Configure two times and button Generate one time to generate project file,
	then use VC2008 to open Project.sln and build debug and release version of .lib files)

	Then the .lib files go to the folder 3rdparty\lib。

	3. VC2008 main menu->tools->options add include and libraries path of boost & opencv 3rdparty.
	Create C++ console project, add opencv 3rdparty lib path to lib path of the project.  
	Add libjpeg.lib zlib.lib libpng.lib libtiff.lib to lib dependencies.
	Download gil numeric plugin, and unzip to folder boost\gil\extension.

	4. If you want to use directly, please see prebuild.zip.
	Now, I am not sure I can build this project by myself too :-)

II. HOW TO USE
	
	This tool is used to extract png file to reduce size of game assets for game develop under Windows.
	For example, first get a png file from character.exe
	(See also:
		http://khmix.sakura.ne.jp/download.shtml)
	Then save the png file (with alpha layer!) to preview.png, 
	and execute:
		myaffine decompose preview.png output.jpg output.png
		myaffine compose output.jpg output.png compose.png
	Now you can get 2 new extracted images and 1 new compose image if no error happened.
